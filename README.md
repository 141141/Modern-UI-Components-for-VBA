# VBA_TOOLS
Add this Dll to your VBA projects and have some cool UI features. Have only tested in MS Access but it should work in all VBA environment. Works with ACCDE too.

# Interesting features
<ul>
  <li>Show non-blocking notifications</li>
  <li>Show Cool DialogBox</li>
  <li>Show Cool Progressbar<li>
</ul>

### [Show non-blocking notifications]
Inspired from Toastr (https://github.com/CodeSeven/toastr).
Allowing VBA users to show simple notifications without having to wait or stress their VBA application.
With a simple command a little colourful notification pops up with a message without taking any focus or disturbing the user.
I mainly use it to show messages that do not require action. I.e. A mail has arrived or a task has been completed.

## customise your notification like you want:
following customisations are possible now.
```
1.Message   : can contain <a href="">text</a> for hyperlinks (any other html tags are ignored, hyperlink must begin with www or http or https (basically web links only?)
2.Duration in Milli-Seconds (default 2000. 0 will keep the notification for long time.  int.max)
3.Background colour (html colour code)
4.Font colour (html colour code)
5.X,Y position on the desktop
```

```VBA
'used commands
Toastr.Toast "Ups something went wrong!",vberror,0
Toastr.Toast "Yellow weather warning!",vbexclamation,0
Toastr.Toast "You've just received a notification",vbinformation,0
```

in Action

#### how about little interaction with user and show some hyperlinks?
You can have html ```<a href="">text</a>``` tags in your message which will be translated into hyperlinks.

# Show Cool DialogBox
Standard Message boxes are great but sometimes you want little more than standard features.
I.e
<ul>
  <li>Be able to have some colours</li>
  <li>Be able to have more than 3 buttons</li>
  <li>Be able auto-close</li>
  <li>Be able to use HTML tags </li>
  <li>not stressing your vba app with a loop?</li>
</ul>
Meet the new simplified DialogBox for VBA users. This dialogbox will allow above listed features and should help you to keep your application colourful. :) This feature is still under development and could some feedback from testers.

There is vba wrapper in the sample accdb which can be extended as per your need. It uses the 3rd party JSON Converter plugin with some miner fixes from my side.

```
  'usign the wrapper it would be as simple as 
  Debug.Print gDll.DialogRich("This is a title", "Some content", (vbExclamation + vbYesNo))
```

# Show cool Progressbar
Progressbars are crucial element when informing users about a progress. Meet the cool progressbar which can pop up on top of your application at any time with a simple code as such as.

```
  Dim ProgressBarID As Long
  ProgressBarID = gDll.ShowProgressBar(100, "Executing your query", "Please wait. We are preparing printer drivers")
    
  ProgressBarID = gDll.SetProgressBar(ProgressBarID, 10, "Waiting for driver..")
```

As usual, you are allowed to change theme colours as per your taste.
![Cool ProgressbarRed](https://github.com/krishKM/VBA_TOOLS/blob/master/screenshots/ProgressBarRed.png)

### note:
```ShowProgressBar and SetProgressBar``` returns an ID which you can refer your progressbar to. This also allows VBA users to have multiple progressbars at the same time. 

here some samples.



# [Other futures that are interesting]

### Save Clipboard images to local file
Sometimes, simple things can be very dificult in VBA. If you are after saving clipboard image to a local path. Check this function.

``` SaveClipboardToImage(string PathToSave, string FileName, string ImageType) ``` All parameters are optional and by default Jpeg image type is used. If the clipbord object contains any images, it will be saved wherever you want and the file path is returned.
in the sample accdb, there is a wrapper ```SaveClipboardToImage``` check it out.



### [Receive SignalR Messages]
This works for me because I do have own signalR server but generally is under development or say not ready yet!
It's like google push messages or any other push message service. You can send notification to all of your logged in yours from one place.
Expanding this, you could also use as a chat server where all logged in participants could send and receive messages among them.
Again without stressing VBA apps.


### ByteToImage
ByteToImage(byte[] byteArraym string TemporaryPath, bool useCache) is a function for MS Access users. Basically you can convert a byteARray received from database into a pictures.
Will return the path of the image file. Use the path as image location for your image property.
something like Me.Image32.Picture = gDll.ByteToImage(ByteArray, "SaveLocationPath")

### FTPS_UPLOAD
simple tool which uses WinScp to upload files securely to your host. Handy if you want to upload some files without doing too much VBA or having activeX components.



# [Upcoming functions]
many... :)
